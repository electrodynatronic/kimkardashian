=============
2015 Electronics students' group project.

This is our attempt to use our new 3D printer along with our new Raspberry Pi skill to build a [RamanPi](http://publiclab.org/notes/flatCat/08-29-2014/ramanpi-the-3d-printable-raspberry-pi-raman-spectrometer) Raman spectrometer.

More details about the project are in the [Project Wiki.](https://github.com/electrodynatronic/kimkardashian/wiki)
